Hello this is a test file that is displayed in plain text.
This program will encrypt this test to display how network traffic can be encrypted.
This program can also decrypt the cipher text by using the same key as the ecryption key.
This can be done because XOR is commutative. Meaning a ^ b = b ^ a.
This displays how network traffic can then be decrypted.
This type of network based encryption is asymmetrical.
